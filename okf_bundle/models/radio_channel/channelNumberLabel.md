# channelNumberLabel

Channel number shown in the list.

## Signature

```dart
StringchannelNumberLabel(String? model, int location)
```

## Docstring

Channel number shown in the list.

For the MXT295, [location] is still the radio's memory slot. The label
matches the Midland screen: channels 1-99, with RPTR 15-22 between them.
Other radios show the slot number unchanged.
