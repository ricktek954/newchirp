Duplex choices for one MXT295 slot.

## Signature

```

## Docstring

Duplex choices for one MXT295 slot.

Channels 1 through 7 stay simplex. Channels 8 through 14 are receive
only. Repeater rows are +5 MHz. A receive channel of 1 through 14 on
any other row also stays simplex. The current value stays in the list
when it is not legal, so the editor shows what is stored.
