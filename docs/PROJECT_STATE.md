# NewChirp Project State

Last updated: 2026-10-31

This is the short operational handoff for restarting work with no conversation
history. `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` remain authoritative for build rules and
release requirements.

## Resume here

- The Windows `1.0.28` installer is live. It bundles the completion-safe
  `drivers/newchirp_icx90.py` override for the Icom IC-E90 and IC-T90A clone
  download, plus the update-button and VC++ redistributable fixes from
  `1.0.27` (the `1.0.26` gate never fired because `RegQueryStringValue` cannot
  read the `Installed` DWORD).
- The Linux `1.0.27` DEB, RPM, AppImage, and Pacman artifacts are live.
- The live downloads page shows separate Linux rows for DEB, RPM, AppImage,
  and Pacman. Keep Pacman labeled for Arch/Omarchy/Manjaro and keep the
  copyable `sudo pacman -U ~/Downloads/NewChirp-linux-x64-<version>.pkg.tar.zst`
  helper under that row.
- The macOS `1.0.27` release is built, signed, notarized, stapled, uploaded,
  and live. It adds the completion-safe IC-E90 clone read fix.
- The RT97L serial protocol is implemented and offline-tested, but its
  provisional channel map still requires validation on physical hardware.
- The experimental GM-32 has physical read/write evidence from 2026-10-25.
  The TS-2000 write-timeout fix still needs a physical upload/read-back retest.
  TS-2000 settings reads now report unsupported cleanly, and failed serial
  operations include a sanitized command trace for support reports.
- The Midland MXT295 has completed physical read and write testing and remains
  labeled experimental.
- `tshirt - i chirp often.png` is an untracked user asset and must not be
  committed or deleted.
- `pubspec.lock` may be locally modified by the installed Flutter SDK. Do not
  include it unless the next task intentionally changes dependencies.
- After rebooting, run `git fetch origin` and inspect new commits before
  choosing the next task.
- Build release artifacts only on their native platform.

## Recently completed

- Published macOS `1.0.27` as a universal signed, notarized, stapled DMG.
  Verified the embedded version, Python runtimes, CHIRP pin, IC-E90 and
  IC-41S driver bundles, strict code signatures, Gatekeeper assessment, server
  checksum, and live platform manifest.
- Published macOS `1.0.26` as a universal signed, notarized, stapled DMG.
  Verified the embedded version, Python runtimes, CHIRP pin, IC-41S driver
  bundle, strict code signatures, Gatekeeper assessment, server checksum, and
  live platform manifest.
- Published macOS `1.0.25` as a universal signed, notarized, stapled DMG.
  Verified the embedded version, Python runtimes, CHIRP pin, new handshake
  overrides, strict code signatures, Gatekeeper assessment, server checksum,
  and live platform manifest.
- Published macOS `1.0.24` as a universal signed, notarized, stapled DMG.
  Verified the embedded version, Python runtimes, CHIRP pin, TS-2000 override,
  strict code signatures, Gatekeeper assessment, server checksum, and live
  platform manifest.
- Published Linux `1.0.26` with DEB, RPM, AppImage, and Pacman
  `.pkg.tar.zst` artifacts. The Pacman package targets Arch/Omarchy and
  declares `libglvnd` and `mesa` dependencies for OpenGL runtime support.
- Verified Linux `1.0.26` with `flutter analyze`, `flutter test` (147 tests),
  package metadata checks, matching server hashes, public HTTP 200 checks, and
  container launch smoke tests for DEB on Ubuntu, AppImage on Ubuntu, RPM on
  Fedora, and Pacman on Arch.
- Fixed the live Linux downloads page so AppImage and Pacman are separate
  rows. The Pacman row is labeled Arch/Omarchy/Manjaro and includes the
  copyable `sudo pacman -U` install command.
- Fixed the AppImage builder to bundle architecture-specific Mesa software
  rasterizer drivers from Debian/Ubuntu library paths.
- Native CHIRP image import for `.img`, `.icf`, `.itm`, and `.d72`.
- Radio-aware channel slots and table sorting by memory location.
- Drag-and-drop channel rearrangement through occupied radio memory slots.
- Standard DTCS fallback codes when radio metadata is unavailable.
- TD-H3 uploads now use one clone handshake instead of probing and then
  handshaking again.
- TK-880 channel operations use CHIRP subdevices/zones.
- Multi-zone selector with real zone names and channel counts.
- Added a generic CHIRP banks/zones editor with rename, channel membership,
  and spare-zone creation. DM-32UV offline image tests cover multi-zone
  membership; physical zone write validation is still pending.
- Zone switching reloads from the saved parent image and preserves other zones
  during upload.
- Radio prompt HTML is stripped and driver "click OK" text is rewritten to the
  actual NewChirp button label.
- Searchable abbreviation glossary and channel-header tooltips.
- Update downloads are restricted to exact HTTPS URLs on `newchirp.net`.
- The startup and Help-menu update checks now offer an in-app download and
  install flow. macOS verifies the replacement app before relaunching;
  Windows requires a valid Authenticode signature; Linux hands the downloaded
  package to the native package manager.
- Added read-only MOTOTRBO CPS2 Zone XML import for conventional analog and
  DMR channels.
- Added persistent empty-slot visibility, placement-aware channel insertion,
  and direct drag or menu movement between radio memory slots.
- Bundled Linux and Windows Python runtime hashes are pinned in build scripts.
- CHIRP `.py` and `.mod` driver modules can be loaded from
  **Load CHIRP driver module…** in the top action bar for the current session.
- Loaded modules can add or override radio drivers; the radio catalog refreshes
  after loading and unloading.
- User-loaded CHIRP modules run behind a macOS Seatbelt or Linux bubblewrap
  sandbox; Windows refuses module loading until it can provide an equivalent
  sandbox.
- CHIRP release downloads are pinned to one commit and verified by SHA-256.
- FT-60 reads now tell the user to hold PTT only after the serial port is open,
  with read-specific recovery guidance if the initial frame times out.
- RepeaterBook search supports amateur and GMRS results, optional proximity
  filtering, city/county sorting, local result filtering, an interactive map,
  multi-select, and insertion into the current library.
- Radio model selection now supports type-ahead filtering by manufacturer or
  model, compact queries such as `uv5r`, keyboard selection, and bounded result
  rendering for the growing catalog.
- Added experimental read-only Radtel RT-950 and Connect Systems CS750 support,
  plus reusable raw SCSI/RAP transport for compatible radios.
- Added experimental read-only Retevis RT97L support with 16-channel parsing,
  CTCSS/DCS decoding, and hardware-safe upload blocking.
- Added an experimental Baofeng GM-32 profile derived from the official
  UV-32 CPS, including DTR/RTS handling, ten bank-name records, GMRS channel
  rules, and physical read/write evidence.
- Added an experimental Midland MXT295 driver with physical read/write
  evidence, Midland channel numbering, and Radio & Modes settings.
- Fixed TS-2000 uploads that exceeded the stock one-second command timeout.
- TS-2000 settings requests now stop with a clear unsupported message instead
  of downloading all channels and failing in `get_settings()`.
- Radio bridge failures now include a bounded communication trace with the
  failed command, memory location, timing, result, and detected radio ID while
  omitting channel contents.
- Kept the channel-table vertical scrollbar pinned to the visible right edge
  while the columns scroll horizontally.
- Added CHIRP module sandboxing, pinned CHIRP source downloads, a file-save
  warning that distinguishes files from radio writes, and Channel Library
  Discard/Write controls tied to the stored radio image.

## Known limitations and follow-ups

- Confirm the FT-60 manual-read sequence on physical hardware. The fix waits
  to tell the user to hold PTT until after the serial port is open.
- TK-880 multi-zone support still needs a report from a physical five-zone
  radio. The automated test uses CHIRP's `Kenwood_TK-880.img`.
- TD-H3 upload uses a protocol-level fake serial test. Physical hardware
  confirmation is still desirable.
- Building a repeater list without radio metadata uses the standard CTCSS and
  DTCS tables, so the TX/RX tone selectors remain usable before a radio image
  is loaded.
- CHIRP drivers can expose additional subdevice types beyond the zones handled
  for the TK-880.
- CHIRP modules run in a sandbox that blocks the home folder, other drives,
  and the network. A module can still use the selected radio and this
  session's files, and a bad module can still damage the radio. Windows
  refuses to load a module until a real Windows sandbox exists. Linux needs
  bubblewrap (`bwrap`). Modules that need packages NewChirp does not bundle
  may fail to import.
- The macOS raw SCSI helper for experimental mass-storage radios is currently
  compiled for Apple Silicon only; live CS750 reads on Intel Macs still need a
  universal or x86_64 helper build and hardware validation.
- The experimental Retevis RT97L channel map and serial handshake still need a
  physical read and comparison against an official CPS export before uploads
  can be enabled.
- Forum like counts and website-side ranking are a separate website project,
  not part of this Flutter repository.
- The direct updater is first shipped in 1.0.23 and has automated coverage.
  Exercise the full in-app update path from 1.0.26 to 1.0.27.
- The roadmap in `docs/SOFTWARE_ROADMAP.md` is older than this handoff and
  contains stale release-status items. Update it when doing broader roadmap
  maintenance.

## Resume checklist

1. Run `git status --short --branch`.
2. Run `git fetch origin` and inspect any new commits before editing.
3. Preserve the untracked T-shirt image and any other unrelated user files.
4. Run `flutter analyze`.
5. Run `flutter test`.
6. Run `python3 test/chirp_bridge_upload_test.py -v`.
7. Run `./scripts/update_okf.sh` after changing `lib/` or `scripts/`.

## macOS release checklist

Only build and publish the macOS artifact from this Mac.

1. Confirm the requested version and update both `pubspec.yaml` and
   `_newChirpVersion` in `lib/main.dart`.
2. Run the verification commands above.
3. Commit and push before producing the artifact.
4. Run `flutter build macos --release`.
5. Verify version, build number, Python runtime, and CHIRP tree in the app.
6. Run `bash scripts/sign_macos_release.sh`.
7. Build the DMG with `scripts/build_macos_dmg.py`.
8. Sign the DMG with the Developer ID Application identity.
9. Submit with `xcrun notarytool submit --keychain-profile newchirp --wait`.
10. Staple and validate the ticket.
11. Mount the DMG and verify:
    - `CFBundleShortVersionString`
    - `CFBundleVersion`
    - strict `codesign`
    - Gatekeeper `spctl`
12. Upload to `/opt/newchirp/public/downloads/NewChirp-<version>.dmg`.
13. Compare the local and server SHA-256 checksums.
14. Verify the platform entry in `/api/releases/latest`.

Do not wait for or trigger Windows or Linux builds from this host. Each
platform is built and published on its native machine.
